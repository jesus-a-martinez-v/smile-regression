# Smile Regression

A set of simple examples of regression tasks implemented using [Smile](https://haifengl.github.io/smile/).

![Man smiling](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-regression/blob/master/assets/smile1.jpeg)

Each example is self contained in its own package and object under `src/main/scala/<package name>`. The corresponding data and the description is under `src/main/resources/<package name>` and in this folder you'll find a thorough description of the dataset.

## Installation

The best way to run each example is to just import it in IntelliJ as an sbt project. You'll need:

- Scala 2.12.6.
- SBT 1.1.6

## Examples:

- [Decision Trees.](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-regression/tree/master/src/main/scala/dt)
- [Gradient Boosting Trees.](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-regression/tree/master/src/main/scala/gbm)
- [Lasso Regression.](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-regression/tree/master/src/main/scala/lasso)
- [Ordinary Least Squares.](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-regression/tree/master/src/main/scala/ols)
- [Random Forest.](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-regression/tree/master/src/main/scala/randomforest)
- [Ridge Regression.](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-regression/tree/master/src/main/scala/ridge)
- [Support Vector Regressor.](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-regression/tree/master/src/main/scala/svm)
- [Radial Basis Function Network.](https://github.com/jesus-a-martinez-v/smile-regression/tree/master/src/main/scala/rbfnet)

It is important to note these examples aren't optimized for performance nor accuracy. They're for learning and reference purposes only.
